# Performance budgets — Bitbounce

Committed budgets and how each is enforced (owner task TH-1; sources: plan
D8/RES-7 user-approved acceptance formalization, town-hall hero claims).
Latency and frame budgets are the product's feel — these are contracts, not
aspirations.

## 1. Audio timing — "notes audible within ±2 ms of musical time"

The user-facing guarantee is formalized (user-approved 2026-09-02) as three
enforcement layers, because real-time audio can never be asserted against a
wall clock:

| Layer             | Budget                                                                                                 | Where enforced                                                                                                                                          |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Unit (exact)   | scheduled `when` equals `timeAtStep(step)` exactly                                                     | node Vitest (`tests/*.test.ts`): time math, scheduler with fake clock, per-step delivery                                                                |
| 2. Offline render | onset sample within ONE render quantum (128 samples ≈ 2.9 ms @ 44.1 kHz) of `timeAtStep(step) × 44100` | browser Vitest (`tests/browser/scheduler-budget.test.ts`): real worklet via `addModule` on OfflineAudioContext, onsets found by sample-energy detection |
| 3. E2E smoke      | ≥90% of onsets within ±10 ms of the audio-clock prediction                                             | Playwright e2e (lands with HW-4)                                                                                                                        |

Layer 2 also discharges the IM-3 caveat: it verifies the REAL
`AudioWorkletProcessor.process()` loop, not the node-side DSP twin.

## 2. Frame rate

- **Target: 60 fps** with all four lanes playing + editing (design D9/playhead
  is rAF + transform, never framework state).
- **CI floor (committed TH-1): ≥95% of frame intervals < 33.4 ms (~30 fps)**
  while the built app plays and a scripted burst of 200 cell toggles runs.
  Rationale (recorded choice): CI shared runners make a hard 60 fps gate
  flaky; the 30 fps floor catches regressions (layout thrash, reactive
  playhead, sync recompiles) deterministically. A true 60 fps gate moves to
  e2e on controlled hardware later if needed.
- **Long-task guard: every toggle batch blocks the event loop < 50 ms.**
- Enforced in `tests/browser/frame-budget.test.ts` against the REAL built
  bundle (globalSetup runs `vite build`; the test imports the built module
  and measures the mounted stage).
- Local measured baseline (M1 MacBook, headless Chromium 151): 181 frames /
  3 s, median 16.6 ms, max ≈ 21.9 ms, 0 frames ≥ 33.4 ms, worst toggle
  block ≤ 4.0 ms.

## 3. Bundle size — ≤ 300 KB gz initial

- Enforced from TH-2 onward as a CI gate on the build artifact:
  `npm run check:bundle` (scripts/check-bundle.mjs) runs after `npm run
build` in CI, measures initial-load JS (entry chunk + every chunk it
  EAGERLY statically imports, gz -9) plus all woff2 bytes, prints a
  per-category breakdown (js / fonts / worklet), and exits non-zero over
  either budget (JS ≤ 300 KB gz, fonts ≤ 50 KB).
- TH-2 code-splitting: the export pipelines load ON DEMAND via dynamic
  import from the Projects popover — the initial bundle never pays for the
  MIDI encoder (midi-file) or the offline render/WAV encoder. The worklet
  asset stays eagerly referenced by URL in the main chunk (audio needs it
  at first play, not lazily); it is fetched on play, never module-imported.
- Current (TH-2 build evidence, gz -9): initial JS **41.90 KB** (single
  entry chunk, was 48.91 KB vite-gzip pre-split); lazy: exportMidi 4.56 KB,
  exportWav 2.23 KB, worklet 4.63 KB (fetched at first play); CSS 11.91 KB
  gz; fonts 37.02 KB raw woff2 on disk (Silkscreen 400/700 are inlined into
  the CSS as data URLs under Vite's 4 KB limit).
- res-9 preload discipline: index.html preloads ONLY the critical
  font-display:swap faces that ship as separate files (Departure Mono,
  IBM Plex Mono 400). The font-display:optional faces (VT323, Press Start
  2P) and Plex 500 are never preloaded; the stage does not depend on them.

## 4. Fonts — ≤ 50 KB total

- Pixel faces (D9: Silkscreen / Departure Mono / VT323 / Press Start 2P /
  IBM Plex Mono fallback) must stay under 50 KB total; checked at DES
  milestones and folded into the TH-2 size gate.

## 5. Voice load

- Worst case committed: 16 simultaneous voices (4 lanes × stacked chords +
  full drum kit) + metronome through the real graph, offline.
- Must render without error, with zero NaN/Infinity samples and a sane
  peak (no runaway). Enforced in `tests/browser/voice-load.test.ts`.

## 6. Background tab (TH-3 behavior contract)

What **continues** when the tab is hidden:

- Audio playback, in full. The scheduler's refill timer is throttled by the
  browser to ≥ 1 Hz in hidden tabs, but all timing derives from
  `ctx.currentTime` (the hardware sample clock, unaffected by throttling),
  and the **1.5 s event horizon** keeps the worklet queue fed at even a
  1 Hz refill cadence. Proven in `tests/background-tab.test.ts`: a full
  virtual minute at a simulated 1 Hz clamp schedules every 16th-note tick
  exactly once, zero misses.
- The event queue refill itself, idempotently. Waking from throttle can
  coalesce/delay timer callbacks; the scheduler's `generatedUntil` cursor
  makes refill a pure forward latch — a burst of refills at an unchanged
  audio clock never double-schedules events already in the worklet queue.

What **pauses**: every `requestAnimationFrame` loop (the browser suspends
rAF in hidden tabs). That is the Booth playhead readout and the grid
renderer's sweep/glow loop — presentation only, never scheduling.

What the **user sees on refocus**: the playhead unparks and resyncs in one
frame. Position reads (`Transport.getLoopTime` / `getPosition`) are pure
functions of `ctx.currentTime` — no rAF timestamp is ever accumulated — so
the first visible frame recomputes from the live audio clock: no time jump,
no drift, no replayed animation. Unit-proven in `tests/background-tab.test.ts`
(resync-from-clock); the real-context contract (audio clock continuity
across a synthetic `visibilitychange` window, exact tick times, refocus
resync) is asserted in `tests/browser/background-tab.test.ts`.

Honest CI limitation: headless Chromium does not actually clamp timers or
suspend rAF on a synthetic visibility change, so real park/throttle behavior
is verified by the human session protocol (R12), not in CI.

## Harness notes (D8/RES-7)

- Browser project: Vitest browser mode, playwright provider, Chromium pinned
  by the `playwright` version in `package.json`/lockfile; headless when CI;
  `workers: 1`; Chromium launched with
  `--autoplay-policy=no-user-gesture-required`.
- Offline renders preload the full event list before `startRendering()`
  (day-one contract) plus a settle delay for worklet message delivery.
- Node/jsdom can never assert audio (jsdom Web Audio open since 2020, #2900).
